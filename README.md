# Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forest-Portfolio-Project
As it is a porfolio project for Decision trees and random forest, i have used other algos in this repo too like KNN, isolation forest, logistic regression.
arooun all these algorithms Decision tree , random forest classifier and logistic regression performed outstanding wheras KNN also ended up with 99.47% accuraracy while isolation forest did not worked well in this scenario giving un satisfactory results.
Information about the dataset and column is defined under the notebook.
